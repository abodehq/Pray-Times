Pray Times
==========

Welcome to Pray Times, an Islamic project aimed at providing an open-source library for calculating Muslim prayers times.

Project Source : http://praytimes.org  
Project Languges Support: Java Script, Python, PHP, Java, C++, C#, Objective C

You can choose other islamic services by visiting our web site : <https://mos7af.com>

##General Usage

The first step for using PrayTimes in a web-page or widget is to include it using a line like this:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="PrayTimes.js"></script> 
After including PrayTimes.js, an object named prayTimes is created and is ready to use. We can immediately get the prayer times (using the default settings) from this object. For example, to get today's prayer times for a location with latitude 43, longitude -80, and time zone -5, we can call:

    prayTimes.getTimes(new Date(), [43, -80], -5);
There are several functions for adjusting calculation parameters. For example, we can call the following function (before calling getTimes) to change the calculation method to ISNA:

    prayTimes.setMethod('ISNA'); 
Details of the functions available in PrayTimes along with their description are provided below.

##Get Prayer Times

The following function is used to retrieve prayer times for a given date and location:

###`getTimes (date, coordinates, timezone, dst, format)`
The input parameters are described below:

####date
The date for which prayer times are calculated. You can use new Date() to specify today. Date can be also entered as a triple [year, month, day]. For example, [2009, 2, 26] specifies February 26, 2009.
####coordinates
Specifies the coordinates of the input location as a triple [latitude, longitude, elevation]. Latitude is a real number between -90 and 90, longitude is between -180 and 180, and elevation is a positive number, specifying the height in meters with respect to the surrounding terrain. The elevation parameter is optional. Examples of valid coordinates are [-43.2, 80.6] and [12.5, -25.8, 300].
####timezone
The difference to Greenwich time (GMT) in hours. If omitted or set to 'auto', timezone is extracted from the system.
####dst
Daylight Saving Time: 1 if date is in daylight saving time, 0 otherwise. If omitted or set to 'auto', dst is extracted from the system.
####format
Output time format, according to the following table:

| Format | Description                   | Example |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------|
| 24h    | 24-hour time format           | 16:45   |
| 12h    | 12-hour time format           | 4:45 pm |
| 12hNS  | 12-hour format with no suffix | 4:45    |
| Float  | Floating point number         | 16.75   |

####Return Value

`getTimes` return an associative array containing 9 prayer times (see here for the list of times and their definition). Each time can be accessed thorough its name. For example, if the output of getTimes function is stored in an object times, the time for sunrise can be accessed through times.sunrise.

###Example 1

    var times = prayTimes.getTimes(new Date(), [43, -80], -5);
    document.write('Sunrise : '+ times.sunrise)
##Set Calculation Method

There are several conventions for calculating prayer times. The default convention used in PrayTimes is Muslim World League. You can change the calculation method using the following function:

###`setMethod (method)`
method can be any of the followings:

| Method  | Description                                   |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| MWL     | Muslim World League                           |
| ISNA    | Islamic Society of North America              |
| Egypt   | Egyptian General Authority of Survey          |
| Makkah  | Umm al-Qura University                        |
| Karachi | University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi       |
| Tehran  | Institute of Geophysics, University of Tehran |
| Jafari  | Shia Ithna Ashari (Ja`fari)                   |

More information on the above calculation methods is provided here.


###Example 2

    prayTimes.setMethod('Makkah');
##Adjusting Parameters

The calculating parameters can be adjusted using the following function:

###`adjust (parameters)`
parameters is an associative array composed of any number of the following parameters:

| Parameter | Values        | Description                   | Sample Value |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| imsak     | degrees       | twilight angle                | 18           |
| minutes   | minutes       | minutes before fajr           | 10 min       |
| fajr      | degrees       | twilight angle                | 15           |
| dhuhr     | minutes       | minutes after mid-day         | 1 min        |
| asr       | method        | asr juristic method *         | Standard     |
| factor    | shadow length | factor for realizing asr      | 1.7          |
| maghrib   | degrees       | twilight angle                | 4            |
| minutes   | minutes       | minutes after maghrib         | 15 min       |
| isha      | degrees       | twilight angle                | 18           |
| minutes   | minutes       | minutes after maghrib         | 90 min       |
| midnight  | method        | midnight method *             | Standard     |
| highLats  | method        | higher latitudes adjustment * | None         |

\* means see the following tables.

###asr methods
| Method   | Description (More Info)                                |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Standard | Shafii, Maliki, Jafari and Hanbali (shadow factor = 1) |
| Hanafi   | Hanafi school of tought (shadow factor = 2)            |

###midnight methods
| Method   | Description                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Standard | The mean time from Sunset to Sunrise |
| Hanafi   | The mean time from Maghrib to Fajr   |

###higher latitudes methods
| Method      | Description (More Info)              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| None        | No adjustments                       |
| NightMiddle | The middle of the night method       |
| OneSeventh  | The 1/7th of the night method        |
| AngleBased  | The angle-based method (recommended) |

####Example 3

    prayTimes.adjust( {fajr: 16, dhuhr: '5 min', asr: 'Hanafi', isha: 15} );
##Tuning Times

You can further tune calculated prayer times (for precaution) using the following function:

###`tune (offsets)`
where offsets is an associative array containing time offsets in minutes for each prayer time.


####Example 4

    prayTimes.tune( {sunrise: -1, sunset: 3.5} );
Notes:
By default, PrayTimes rounds minutes to the nearest values. To round a specific time up, you can tune it by +0.5 minutes, and to round it down, you can tune it by -0.5 minutes.
Tuning is the last step after calculating step, and thus, it has no effect on the calculation parameters. For example, if Isha is set to be 90 minutes after sunset, tuning sunset by 5 minutes will not push Isha forward.
